#SNAKE GAME

SNAKE is a classic game where you play as the snake and you feed yourself with the food that randomly pops around the board. My variation of the game speeds up the snake the more food you eat.

###Technologies
* Created snake as an array to make it easier to add length into it.
* Set up the board with canvas
* Move snake inside the canvas by adjust the x and y coordinates.
* Direct the snake by arrow keys using event.which to distinguish which key is being used.
* Stores high scores in local storages. [See MDN docs for more info](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage) 



###DESIGN APPROACH
My design approach is basically reviving a retro game. I used "Press Start 2P" as font to add that 8-bit old classic game look.

####Basically like any game, it starts out with a home page:

####Goes to the game and lets you play:

#NOTE:
Hosted repo and the game's code repo are different. I stored the game locally under 3 directories. Trying to keep it tidy so I have to make another repo for the game to be hosted on its own folder.
