# SNAKE GAME

![SNAKE PHOTO](http://i.imgur.com/bJZMrbL.png)  


SNAKE is a classic game where you play as the snake and you feed yourself with the food that randomly pops around the board. My variation of the game speeds up the snake the more food you eat.  


### TECHNOLOGY

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Firebase  


### FUNCTIONALITY

* Created snake as an array to make it easier to add length into it.
* Set up the board with canvas
* Move snake inside the canvas by removing one piece of the tail and moving it to the head repeatedly.
* Direct the snake by arrow keys using event.which to distinguish which key is being used.  

### INSTRUCTIONS
* Move snake with your arrow keys.
* Collect as much food as you can.
* **DON'T DIE**

### DESIGN APPROACH
My design approach is basically reviving a retro game. I used "Press Start 2P" as font to add that 8-bit old classic game look.

#### Basically like any game, it starts out with a home page:

#### Goes to the game and lets you play:
